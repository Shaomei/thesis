We compare two extreme temporal patterns in the decay rate of URLs embedded in tweets, defining a prediction task to distinguish between URLs that fade rapidly following their peak of popularity and those that fade more slowly. Our experiments show a strong association between the content and the temporal dynamics of information: given unigram features extracted from corresponding HTML webpages, a linear SVM classifier can predict the temporal pattern of URLs with high accuracy. We further explore the content of URLs in the two temporal classes using various textual analysis techniques (via LIWC and trend detection). We find that the rapidly-fading information contains significantly more words related to negative emotion, actions, and more complicated cognitive processes, whereas the persistent information contains more words related to positive emotion, leisure, and lifestyle.},

Incorporating survival analysis, we constructed a novel model to capture the three major properties of information diffusion: speed, scale, and range. On the whole, we find that some properties of the tweets themselves predict greater information propagation but that properties of the users, the rate with which a user is mentioned historically in particular, are equal or stronger predictors. Implications for end users and system designers are discussed.}},
